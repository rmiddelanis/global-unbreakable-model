# Explanation of exposure model content

## Definition of column headers

Each exposure `csv` contains the following column headers, as briefly defined below

- **ASSET_ID**: Unique identifier for an asset, which comprises a group of buildings sharing similar attributes and location
- **BUILDINGS**: The total number of buildings comprising the asset. A building unit is defined as a permanent, separate, and independent structure designed to serve any activity. For constructions comprising blocks, terraced buildings, or buildings enclosed by common fencing, a building unit refers to the superstructure that is structurally designed to respond independently under seismic loads
- **COST_CONTENTS_USD**: The cost of contents in each asset
- **COST_NONSTRUCTURAL_USD**: The cost of nonstructural components in each asset
- **COST_PER_AREA_USD**: The average replacement cost per unit area (in 2021 US$/sq.m., including the structural and nonstructural components, but not the building contents) 
- **COST_STRUCTURAL_USD**: The cost of structural components in each asset
- **DWELLING**: A self-contained residential space within a building designed for habitation by one or more individuals or families. For example, a multi-story residential building is comprised of numerous dwelling units, such as multiple apartments within the same structure. Conversely, in a single-family detached unit, the number of dwelling units and buildings is the same
- **ESTABLISHMENT**: A single physical location where economic activities occur (e.g., services or industrial operations). An establishment is often characterized by having a specific address, management, and operational control, distinct from other units of the same company or organization.
- **ID_1**: ID for the first administrative level, matches either the ID used in the national census, the administrative division boundary vector files, or both
- **ID_i**: ID for the administrative level `i` 
- **NAME_1**: Name of the first administrative level
- **NAME_i**: Name of the administrative level `i` 
- **LONGITUDE**, **LATITUDE**: Geographical coordinates assigned to the asset for risk calculations. In general, these locations do not represent building-specific geolocations, but are either aggregated at a representative point for the lowest administrative level or are the result of the spatial disaggregation algorithm (and thus still represent aggregated assets, but at a finer resolution)
- **OCCUPANCY**: The primary occupancy class: `Res` for residential, `Com` for commercial, and `Ind` for industrial
- **OCCUPANTS_PER_ASSET**: The number of residents in each residential asset
- **OCCUPANTS_PER_ASSET_AVERAGE**: The time-averaged number of occupants in each asset (residential, commercial, industrial) 
- **OCCUPANTS_PER_ASSET_DAY**: The average number of occupants in each asset (residential, commercial, industrial) during the daytime period
- **OCCUPANTS_PER_ASSET_NIGHT**: The average number of occupants in each asset (residential, commercial, industrial) during the nighttime period
- **OCCUPANTS_PER_ASSET_TRANSIT**: The average number of occupants in each asset (residential, commercial, industrial) during the transit time period
- **TAXONOMY**: Building taxonomy string that is used for mapping vulnerability functions for the asset
- **TOTAL_AREA_SQM**: The total floor area comprising the asset (sq.m.)
- **TOTAL_REPL_COST_USD**: The total replacement cost for the asset (in 2021 US$, including the structural, nonstructural components, and building contents) 

## Where can I find additional information on the defined building classes?

The building classes defined within this exposure model follow the GEM Taxonomy v3.2 convention. Please refer to the [GEM Taxonomy Glossary](https://taxonomy.openquake.org/) for additional details on taxonomy substrings and the `Taxonomy_tables_v3.2.xlsx` available [here](https://github.com/gem/gem_taxonomy/tree/master).

# ü§î Frequently asked questions 

### Which version am I seeing? How to change the version?
By default, you will see the files in the repository in the  `main` branch. Each version of the model that is released is marked with a `tag`. By changing the tag version at the top of the repository, you can see the files for a given version.

Note that the `main` branch could contain the work-in-progress of the next version of the model.

### How do I download the data for a given version?
For each version, a related zip file is available in the [release section](https://github.com/gem/global_exposure_model/releases).

### Administrative regions 

The exposure models typically use the names of the administrative regions available in each country's census information, when available. However, depending on the available source data and base year for which the models are derived, the number of first-level administrative divisions and their names may differ from the _current_ divisions and names for each country. GEM does not provide associated boundary files.
